Since your business focuses on website creation, your homepage should immediately showcase your expertise, build trust, and guide visitors toward taking action. Here's a minimal yet effective homepage structure:  

### **2. Showcase of Your Work**  
- A section displaying **featured projects** or a **screenshot slider**  
- A link to the full **Projects** page  

### **3. Why Choose Us? (Unique Selling Points)**  
- A few **key benefits** (e.g., fast delivery, mobile-friendly, SEO-optimized, affordable pricing)  
- Icons or short descriptions for each benefit  

### **4. Services Overview**  
- A preview of your main services (e.g., "Custom Website Design," "E-commerce Solutions," "SEO Optimization")  
- A **CTA to the full Services page**  

### **5. Testimonials & Social Proof**  
- Show client reviews or video testimonials  
- Logos of brands youâ€™ve worked with (if applicable)  

### **6. Pricing Teaser (Optional)**  
- A small section teasing your pricing (e.g., "Plans starting at E1,500")  
- A button linking to the **Pricing** page  

### **7. Final CTA & Contact Info**  
- A strong call-to-action (e.g., *"Ready to Get Started? Let's Talk!"*)  
- Contact details (email, phone, or WhatsApp)  
- A simple **contact form** or a button linking to the **Contact page**
